# Instructions for Running my Project

First you will need pip and Pillow.
pip is automatically installed on Windows and OS X/Mac, so if you are on Windows or OS X then you won't have a problem. If you are on Linux you will have to install pip3 with this command in yout terminal: sudo apt-get install python3-pip. Then you are set.
Next you will have to install Pillow and all you have to do on Windows is open your command prompt. Then you type in pip install pillow. On OS X and Linux uoi will open the terminal and type in pip3 install pillow.
Before you run the program you will need to place your pictures .jpeg or .png in the folder called Original Images. If you want to add a logo rename it to Logo and place it in the logo folder and make sure it is a .png.
Once you have put the images in you can run the program called MainProgram.py where everything is done from.
If you would like to use the three different programs then keep saying yes.
If you find using the Main Program troublesome you can open one of the 3 different programs and start them manually.
Each program will make itself a save that has a different name, like the thumbnail program will call itself, OriginalImageNameThumbnail.jpeg.
You are done once you have gone through all of that, manipulate images to your heart's content.
